                    <p>The pizza that we know and love today, with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, originated in Naples, Italy, <br> in the late 18th century. <br> At that time, Naples was a bustling port city with a thriving working-class population. <br> Legend has it that the first pizza was created by a baker named Raffaele Esposito, who was asked <br> by the queen of Italy to make a pizza for her <br> visit to Naples.Esposito made a pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, <br> and basil to represent the colors of the Italian flag, and it became an instant hit.</p>
